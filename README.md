# Maven_Assignment
In this Project, I made a module named 'assign' and inside the assign module, added two new modules 'cal-api' and 'cal-impl'. Made Calculator class inside cal-api which will have all the +, -, *, / method for integer value.
Then, made Application class inside the cal-impl module. Lastly, added three plugins named as 'CheckStyle plugin', 'Spot bug plugin' and 'executable plugin'.
